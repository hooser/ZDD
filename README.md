# ZDD
to help Tongjiers make groups.

  The purpose of ZDD(zu duo duo, 组多多) is to help the students in Tongji University to make groups. Many Tongji
students are limited in social activities, which bothers them a lot. The program is aimed to change such
a situation. The program is written by the languages of PHP, html5 and sql. It's based on B/S structure and it runs
on Wampserver. Before you start the program, you should load the file ruangong.sql which is the database of the program.
It has four main charpters: 

  1. online-shopping: "Buy more, each is cheaper" is a sale strategy. However, most time we can't buy so many
things. At this time, the program will help you. You wil only need to release your idea of making group to
shop online in ZDD website. 
  2. studying activities: The SITP requires at least three members. When you want to find members from different
department, you may release the information in our website including your item's name, purpose, number of members,
and so on. Anyone interested in your project will find you.
  3.4. Similarly, you will find it useful in making groups to take sports and carpooling
